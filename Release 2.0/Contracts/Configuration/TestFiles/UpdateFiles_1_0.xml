  Important points on Pre and Post DLLS
  =======================================
  1. Include an <UpdateFile> entry to download these DLL from the update server.
  2. For <PreUpdateAssemblyPath> and <PostUpdateAssemblyPath>, always mention temp folder
  path where all files downloaded before the actual update of file happens.
  
  For ex: If the exe which has AppUpdater component refered is in C:\MyApp\MyUpdater.exe,
  then AppUpdater will first create C:\MyApp\Temp folder to download all update files.
  After successful download, File from Temp folder will be moved as per the <DestinationFolder>
  reference path value.
  Pre and Post DLLs will be in temp folder, hence you can mention these values are shown below.
  <PreUpdateAssemblyPath>temp\MyPreupdate.dll</PreUpdateAssemblyPath>
  
  Important note on {ignore} to use as DestinationFolder="{ignore}"
  =================================================================
  Taking the example of pre and post update DLLs, these DLLs will be downloaded to client
  machine, run and later required to be deleted.
  AppUpdater has default behaviour of moving all files specified in <UpdateFile> list.
  For a given destination folder setting in <UpdateFile>, DestinationFolder="help\" 
  AppUpdater will create (if not present) 'help' folder (in the folder where AppUpdater is
  running) and move update files. 
  
  For DestinationFolder="", update file will be moved to the folder where AppUpdater
  is running.
  
  For DestinationFolder="{ignore}", The update file will be downloaded in temp folder
  but will not be moved anywhere. This file will delete along with temp folder when
  update process is finished.

  SourceURI:         (Requierd) The http(s) URL (without file name) must end with "/" 
  
  DestinationFolder: (Optional) Relative folder path present or to be created on client's machine. 
                     For now, always consider update exe deploying at the top most folder of 
                     the application so that any updates should not require 
                     back traversing (like ..\..\..\App1\update) to parent folders.
                     Ex: DestinationFolder="..\..\..\log1\ll" is not recommended.
                     DestinationFolder="log1\app1\upd2" is corre
                     No value to this attribute will deploy updated file in the folder where updater 
                     is present.
                     
  FileName:          (Requierd) Actual file name present online and available for download.
                     Updater appends "SourceURI + Filename" and then downloads it.
                     
  RenameFileTo:      (Optional) When updater is deploying downloaded update file, if you want
                     deploy file with some other name and file extension, mention that here.
                     
 MoreInfoURL:        (Optional) Online URL to provide more details on currenlty downloading update file.
